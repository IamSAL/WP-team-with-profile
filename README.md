This is a simple WordPress plugin that creates a Wp Team Members Profile. The Wp Team Members Profile allows WordPress admin users to add their settings for a plugin.

You can use this skeleton to add a Wp Team Members Profile to your plugin. This plugin does the following:

- Adds an admin menu item to the left sidebar in the WordPress admin dashboard along with a submenu item including your Wp Team Members Profile
- Creates a Wp Team Members Profile that includes a form
- Saves that form to the database
- Makes sure the settings form fields are pre-populated if it has already been filled out
